# pointer-generator

This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of the ACL paper: Get To The Point: Summarization with Pointer-Generator Networks (See et al., 2017).

While the original paper is built for English, we adapted the structure to a Korean dataset, which required tokenization & preprocessing techniques specific to Korean.

I implemented the entire structure from scratch, but referred to the following repositories:

* https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator
